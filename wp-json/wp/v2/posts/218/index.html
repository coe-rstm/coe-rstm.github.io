Introduction<\/h2><p>On May 2, 2023, the Department of Civil Engineering at Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College (GNDEC) organized an expert talk on &#8220;Road Safety is No Accident&#8221; in collaboration with the Centre of Excellence for Road Safety and Traffic Management. The talk was delivered by Ar. Vivek Sehgal, an Associate Professor at GNDEC School of Architecture and a Ph.D. candidate in Urban Planning. The talk was attended by students, faculty, and the organizations, and was broadcast live on YouTube.<\/p><h2>II. Background<\/h2><p>Ar. Vivek Sehgal is an experienced speaker in the field of road safety, with extensive experience in research and practice. The Department of Civil Engineering at GNDEC is committed to promoting road safety and sustainability through research, education, and community engagement. The Centre of Excellence for Road Safety and Traffic Management is a collaborative initiative between GNDEC and Punjab Police, aimed at improving road safety in the region.<\/p><h2>III. Main topics covered<\/h2><p>During the expert talk, Ar. Vivek Sehgal discussed several topics related to road safety, including modal priority for urban stress, the character of traffic on Indian roads, preventive measures for accidents including road engineering, and calming measures. He emphasized the need to create a road culture that prioritizes safety and responsible driving. He also discussed various strategies and best practices for preventing accidents, such as creating dedicated pedestrian zones, implementing speed limit regulations, and improving road design.<\/p><p>One of the main topics of the talk was modal priority for urban stress, which refers to the allocation of road space for different modes of transportation such as walking, cycling, and public transport. Ar. Sehgal emphasized the importance of giving priority to non-motorized modes of transportation to create safer and more sustainable cities.<\/p><p>Another topic of the talk was the character of traffic on Indian roads, which is characterized by high traffic volumes, mixed traffic, and lack of traffic discipline. Ar. Sehgal discussed the challenges of designing roads in such an environment and highlighted the need for road engineering solutions that are tailored to the Indian context.<\/p><p>Ar. Sehgal also discussed various preventive measures for accidents, such as improving visibility on roads, implementing traffic calming measures, and improving road signage. He emphasized the need for a holistic approach to road safety that includes engineering, education, and enforcement. Key takeaways from the talk included the importance of creating safe and inclusive road environments, the need to prioritize vulnerable road users, and the role of education and awareness in promoting responsible road behavior with four important <strong><em>E\u2019s &#8211; Establishment, Ethics, Etiquettes and Empathy.<\/em><\/strong><\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p>\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-478f646 e-con-boxed e-con\" data-id=\"478f646\" data-element_type=\"container\" data-settings=\"{&quot;content_width&quot;:&quot;boxed&quot;}\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"e-con-inner\">\n\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-5574e05 e-con-full e-con\" data-id=\"5574e05\" data-element_type=\"container\" data-settings=\"{&quot;content_width&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-1cc7d2c elementor-widget elementor-widget-image\" data-id=\"1cc7d2c\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"image.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t<style>\/*! elementor - v3.12.1 - 02-04-2023 *\/\n.elementor-widget-image{text-align:center}.elementor-widget-image a{display:inline-block}.elementor-widget-image a img[src$=\".svg\"]{width:48px}.elementor-widget-image img{vertical-align:middle;display:inline-block}<\/style>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img decoding=\"async\" width=\"378\" height=\"321\" src=\"http:\/\/road.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Picture2.png\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-image-899\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"http:\/\/road.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Picture2.png 378w, http:\/\/road.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Picture2-300x255.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 378px) 100vw, 378px\" \/>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-d98fd19 e-con-full e-con\" data-id=\"d98fd19\" data-element_type=\"container\" data-settings=\"{&quot;content_width&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-f7fc716 elementor-widget elementor-widget-image\" data-id=\"f7fc716\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"image.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img decoding=\"async\" width=\"370\" height=\"321\" src=\"http:\/\/road.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Picture1.png\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-image-898\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"http:\/\/road.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Picture1.png 370w, http:\/\/road.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/Picture1-300x260.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 370px) 100vw, 370px\" \/>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-f4fdbac e-con-boxed e-con\" data-id=\"f4fdbac\" data-element_type=\"container\" data-settings=\"{&quot;content_width&quot;:&quot;boxed&quot;}\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"e-con-inner\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-1bef078 elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"1bef078\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>IV.
